# MetroRun

A new Flutter application.
Developed to digitize tickets for passengers of Namma Metro, Bangalore.


We have only implemented the UI and not the services (such as payment transactions).
This app allows a user to buy tickets online by selecting one of the available routes(purple line and green line) of Namma Metro.
It allows the user to sign in via their email IDs and buy the ticket accordingly.
The app is built on Flutter for the user interface, using Firebase as the real time database.
The app generates a unique QR code for each ticket.

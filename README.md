# MetroRun

A new Flutter application.
Developed to digitize tickets for passengers of Namma Metro, Bangalore.


We have only implemented the UI and not the services (such as payment transactions).
The app allows the user to sign in via their email IDs and buy the ticket online by selecting 
one of the available routes(purple line and green line) of Namma Metro.
A unique QR code is generated for each ticket.
It's built using Flutter and Firebase.
